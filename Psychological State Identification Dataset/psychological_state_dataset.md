## About Dataset

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/psychological-state-identification-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/psychological-state-identification-dataset)

It simulates biosensor-collected physiological, behavioral, and environmental data to evaluate the psychological states of individuals, particularly students, during ideological and political education (IPE) activities. The dataset supports research on real-time stress and emotional state assessment using biosensors, feature extraction, optimization, and machine learning models.

Purpose
To analyze students' psychological states, stress levels, and emotional involvement during educational activities.
To support the development of machine learning models, specifically the EOO-DLSTM, for identifying psychological states based on physiological and environmental data.
To explore the application of biosensor technology in improving mental health support in IPE.
Dataset Features

1. Physiological Data
   These features are collected from biosensors to evaluate psychological and emotional states:

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) (ms): Indicates stress and relaxation states.
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) (μS): Reflects stress through changes in skin conductivity.
EEG Power Bands: Captures brain activity in Delta, Alpha, and Beta bands.
Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic) (mmHg): Measures cardiovascular response.
Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂) (%): Indicates oxygen levels in the blood.
Heart Rate (BPM): Shows physical or emotional excitement.
Respiration Rate (BPM): Measures breathing activity.
Skin Temperature (°C): Indicates stress or comfort levels.

1. Environmental Factors
   Environmental attributes that can influence students' psychological states:

Ambient Noise Level (dB): Noise intensity during educational activities.
Ambient Light (lux): Light levels, impacting mood and focus.
Room Temperature (°C): Environmental temperature during the session.

1. Behavioral Features
   Behavioral data indicating focus and engagement:

Focus Duration (s): Time spent in sustained attention on a task.
Typing Speed (WPM): Reflects cognitive load and stress.
Click/Interaction Frequency: Tracks engagement level.

1. Psychological Context
   Self-reported or inferred psychological states:

Cognitive Load: (Low, Moderate, High) reflecting mental effort.
Mood State: (Happy, Neutral, Sad, Anxious) representing emotional conditions.
Psychological State: (Stressed, Relaxed, Focused, Anxious) inferred from biosensor data.

1. Task Metadata
   Details of the educational activities:

Task Type: (Lecture, Group Discussion, Assignment, Exam).
Perceived Task Difficulty: Self-reported difficulty scale (1–10).

1. Demographics
   Attributes that describe participants:

Age: Participant age.
Gender: Participant gender (Male, Female, Other).
Educational Level: (High School, Undergraduate, Postgraduate).
Study Major: (Science, Arts, Engineering).
